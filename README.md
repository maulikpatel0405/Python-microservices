# Python-microservices
Will create Python based project to mimic microservices. 

(1) Creating a Virtual Environment with the command : virtualenv ~/.venv
and Activating the Virtual environment when the Shell starts : 
vim ~/.bashrc -> source ~/.venv/bin/activate
(2)Create empty Files: 'Makefile', and all that is seen under the repository.
(3)Populate 'Makefile' 
(4)Set up continuous integration, i.e. Check code for issues like lint errors. GitHub has few templates made for us to build, run, test and deploy the code. Look out for more details in the Action 
(5)Build a cli using python library './cli-fire.py --help ' to test logic.
